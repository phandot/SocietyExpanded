Adds an additional economic system law, Slave Economy, that boosts construction cost and aristocratic investment in agriculture and mining at the cost of increased radicalism from discrimination. The mod also adds the stadium building that produces the new entertainment good. You can select the type of event to showcase at the stadium: aristocratic plays, gladiatorial combat, or football matches.",
